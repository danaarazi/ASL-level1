#Instructions

Thank you for your willingness to put this flyer into your course.  Letting students know about our degrees will go a long way to increasing our graduation rates and growing the program.  This information will be helpful to students to know that they can plan a career in ASL and/or interpreting.  As more students complete the program then we will be able to grow our reputation as an excellent place to learn ASL

Right now I only have one page loaded up here called “[`flyer_html_code.txt`](https://github.com/danaarazi/ASL-level1/blob/master/flyer_html_code.txt)” . You can open this file and just copy and paste the code into your canvas page and it will work.  Please note this document and the HTML code has been written to be compliant with ADA and to work on all canvas courses.  While it may be tempting to edit the page, please refrain from edits to ensure accessibility compliance.

#I have created a canvas page for you and tried to make adding the page as simple as possible.  

##The first step you will need to do is to create a new page in your course.  You can do this by clicking the “+” icon in any module.  
![add_a_page_step_1](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.3cmedia/u_2657/17967/add_a_page_step_1.png “Step 1”)
##You will then need to select “add page” and then [Create Page].  Name the page for example “Degrees in ASL”
![add_a_page_step_2](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.3cmedia/u_2657/17963/add_a_page_step_2.png “Step 2”)
##Now you will need to edit the page. 
![add_a_page_step_3](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.3cmedia/u_2657/17964/add_a_page_step_3.png “Step 3”)
 ##Look for the icon in the bottom right  “  </>  “ and click on this.  This will take you to the html edit page.
![add_a_page_step_4](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.3cmedia/u_2657/17965/add_a_page_step_4.png “Step 4”)

##Insert your code here by just pasting in the code I gave you above.  
![add_a_page_step_5](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.3cmedia/u_2657/17966/add_a_page_step_5.png “Step 5”)
